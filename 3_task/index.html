    <p id="hamlet">(From Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)</p>
    <section id="main">
      <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</p>
      <p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
      <p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
      <p>Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,</p>
      <p>And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep;</p>
      <p>No more; and by a sleep, to say we end</p>
      <p>The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</p>
      <p>That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation</p>
      <p>Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,</p>
      <p>To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,</p>
      <p>For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,</p>
      <p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
      <p>Must give us pause. There's the respect</p>
      <p>That makes Calamity of so long life:</p>
      <p>For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,</p>
      <p>The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,</p>
      <p>The pangs of dispised Love, the Lawâ€™s delay,</p>
      <p>The insolence of Office, and the spurns</p>
      <p>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p>
      <p>When he himself might his Quietus make</p>
      <p>With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear, [F: these Fardels]</p>
      <p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
      <p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
      <p>The undiscovered country, from whose bourn</p>
      <p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</p>
      <p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have,</p>
      <p>Than fly to others that we know not of.</p>
      <p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>
      <p>And thus the native hue of Resolution</p>
      <p>Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,</p>
      <p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment, [F: pith]</p>
      <p>With this regard their Currents turn awry, [F: away]</p>
      <p>And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,</p>
      <p>The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons</p>
      <p>Be all my sins remember'd.</p>
